# AI-Execution-Planner
# Overview

This project is an AI-driven system that understands user queries, infers execution steps, and generates function calls or structured workflows. It utilizes the Google PaLM API for natural language understanding and Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

# Features

- Intent Recognition: Understands technical queries and extracts key actions.
- Workflow Generation: Maps queries to logical execution steps.
- Function Call Generation: Translates user requests into executable function calls.
- Interactive UI: Built using Streamlit for ease of use.

# Tech Stack

- Google PaLM API (for NLP processing)
- Streamlit (for the front-end UI)
- Python(Flask) (backend logic and API handling)

# Next Steps

- Improve function call generation accuracy.
- Add support for more APIs.
- Enhance UI/UX with better visualization tools.

# Conclusion

This AI-based execution planner simplifies technical workflows by converting user queries into structured execution steps. By leveraging the Google PaLM API and Streamlit, it provides an intuitive and powerful interface for automating complex tasks. Future enhancements will focus on expanding API compatibility and refining workflow accuracy, making it even more robust and versatile.
